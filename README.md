# Lael's Notes for Masters Level Mathematics Courses

The following repository is intended for revision and self study, writing down concepts that I learn and struggle with, as well as giving other students (or random people who may stumble across this repo) a chance to explore pure mathematics at the graduate school level. A bare bones undergraduate math degree is a prerequisite, but more often than not I do find myself revising those concepts as well.

The courses I intend to make notes on and continue writing about are (in no particular order)

1. Commutative Algebra
2. Algebraic Geometry 
3. Differential Geometry
4. Functional Analysis
5. Statistical Inference and Data Analysis
6. Operator Algebras

I will continue to add to this list as time progresses. All courses were followed at KU Leuven, beginning in September 2022.
